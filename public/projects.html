                        Open-source software developed by me during my CSIRO summer studentship on the LOCUST system.
                        The LOCUST system is a radio-telescope set designed to engage students in science classrooms
                        with STEM and I developed a code module meant to be used to engage students who are not able
                        to see the visual data of graphs and plots by sonification of the radio waves. This project
                        included extensive speed optimisations and asynchronous programming due to the heavy computation
                        of complex algorithums being run on a Raspberry-Pi.

                        code will take the syntactic tree from the C++ compiler and analyse it to identify
                        various code smells which can roughly be defined as refactorable code, checking a condition
                        to return explicite boolean values rather than returning the value of the condition checked
                        and duplicate code inside if-else statements that can be moved before or after the if-else.
                        More examples and documentation should be available at the fork of the submission repository
                        I have linked.

                        a Python object. There was a lot of refactoring and abstraction involved though to allow
                        me to more easily create the GUI I developed layers of abstraction until it was comparable
                        to HTML for me.
