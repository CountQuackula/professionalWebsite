                <h1>
                    Hi, I'm Faisal!
                </h1>

                <p>
                    I'm currently in the final (penultimate) year of my bachelor studies of Computer Science
                    and actively looking for an opportunity in a few computer fields. Off the top of my head
                    these fields are software engineering, hardware engineering, FPGA engineering and website
                    development. I actively enjoy learning both related and unrelated to my chosen field.
                    Typically I spend my time on learning best practices and emerging technologies
                    across a variety of personally intresting technological disciplines. Secondary to that
                    I prefer learning mathematics, physics and chemistry along side DIY skills such as
                    Woodworking, 3D printing, Electronics and Metalworking. When I'm not endulging in learning
                    I spend time cooking, hiking or gaming with family and friends. I began my journey in
                    computation due to my intrest in mathematics and problem solving which have served me well
                    during my education and I hope will serve me well into my professional career aswell.
